# First of all

## *WHAT IS REST API?*



**A `Representable State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API)` provides a set of methods that a programmer can use via HTTP to send and receive data.**

**Since these methods are over HTTP, any programming language can be used to employ REST APIs.**

> There are thousands of REST APIs available for use. Many of these APIS are paid and limit the number of times you can call . The most secure APIS require setting up OAuth for users to login securely.

**The APIs listed here are completely free and absolutely beginner friendly — no need to figure out how to handle OAuth or pay for their use.**
